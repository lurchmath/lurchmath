/**
 * In a Lurch document, certain sections will be marked as "shells."  These will
 * always be DIVs and will typically contain other document content.  While
 * {@link module:Atoms atoms (as defined in the Atoms module)} are indivisible
 * sections of special, meaningful document content, shells are also special,
 * meaningful document content, but are not indivisible.  They are intended to
 * contain other document content.
 * 
 *  1. The user can edit what sits inside a shell, but the application
 *     determines how the shell is drawn as a visual wrapper around that
 *     content.
 *  2. The user can edit the shells's properties by clicking on it (the visual
 *     boundary around the content, not the content itself) and interacting with
 *     whatever dialog the application pops up in response.
 *  3. There can be many different types of shells.  For example, a theorem
 *     statement may be one type, and a proof or subproof may be another.
 *  4. Like atoms, each shell will typically have some meaning that will be
 *     important when the document is processed in a mathematical way.
 * 
 * Shells are implemented as a subclass of Atoms, overriding some functions in
 * the {@link Atom Atom class} that must be done in a different way for shells,
 * and adding new functions that apply only to Shells.
 * 
 * This module contains tools for working with shells, including the
 * {@link module:Shells.install function} we use to install their
 * mouse event handlers and, most importantly, the
 * {@link module:Shells.Shell class} we use to create an API for working with
 * individual shells.
