/**
 * In a Lurch document, certain sections will be marked as "atoms."  These may
 * be an inline section represented by an HTML span or a block section
 * represented by an HTML div.  Atoms have the following properties.
 * 
 *  1. The user cannot *directly* edit their content.  Rather, the application
 *     determines how the atom appears in the document.  (There are also
 *     meaningful sections of the document that are not indivisible in this way;
 *     see {@link module:Shells the Shells module}.)
 *  2. The user can *indirectly* edit the atom's content by clicking on it and
 *     interacting with whatever dialog the application pops up in response.
 *  3. There can be many different types of atoms.  For example, one atom may be
 *     a mathematical equation while another atom adds an attribute to the
 *     document that contains it; these are two different types, and there will
 *     be other types as well.  The type is stored as an attribute of the atom's
 *     HTML element.
 *  4. Each atom will typically have some meaning that will be important when
 *     the document is processed in a mathematical way.
 * 
 * Atoms are represented in the document by spans and divs with a certain class
 * attached to mark them as atoms, and they are also have their
 * `contenteditable` property set to false, which TinyMCE respects so that the
 * user cannot edit their content (though they can cut, copy, paste, or delete
 * them).
 * 
 * This module contains tools for working with atoms, including the
 * {@link module:Atoms.className class name} we use to distinguish them, the
 * {@link module:Atoms.install function} we use to install their event handlers,
 * and most importantly, the {@link module:Atoms.Atom class} we use to create an
 * API for working with individual atoms.

     * An atom has the following three or four internal parts, called children.
     * If the atom is inline (a span) then each of the children is represented
     * as an inner span, but if the atom is a block (a div) then each of the
     * children is an inner div.
     * 
     *  1. The "metadata" child, which exists only in block-type atoms, and can
     *     contain arbitrarily large HTML metadata, none of which is displayed
     *     in the document for the user to see.  Clients should not read from or
     *     write to this HTML metadata storage directly, but should instead use
     *     the functions in this class designed for that purpose, including
     *     {@link module:Atoms.Atom#getHTMLMetadata getHTMLMetadata()} and
     *     {@link module:Atoms.Atom#setHTMLMetadata setHTMLMetadata()}.  The
     *     reason that this exists only in block-type atoms is because one
     *     cannot put arbitrary HTML inside a span, as one can with a div.
     *  2. The "prefix" child, which is the first child that is visible to the
     *     user in the document.  This may be omitted or empty, but in those
     *     situations where the atom should have some decoration on its left
     *     side (for inline atoms) or its top (for block atoms), such content
     *     can be placed in the prefix.  The client rarely needs to write to the
     *     prefix directly, but can instead use the
     *     {@link module:Atoms.Atom#fillChild fillChild()} function to do so.
     *     You can use this function to read from the prefix when needed.
     *  3. The "body" child, which is where the main content of the atom should
     *     go.  For example, if the atom represents a mathematical equation, the
     *     typeset version of that equation can go here.  Again, to specify the
     *     body content, use {@link module:Atoms.Atom#fillChild fillChild()}.
     *  4. The "suffix" child, which functions just like the prefix, except
     *     appears at the end (right side for inline atoms, bottom for block
     *     atoms).  Again, to specify the suffix content, use
     *     {@link module:Atoms.Atom#fillChild fillChild()}.
     * 
     * When you call this function, both parameters are optional.  If you do not
     * specify the type of child, it defaults to the body, and if the child you
     * request does not exist, it defaults to creating it for you.  (In a brand
     * new atom, there are no children; it is empty.)  If you do not wish the
     * child to be created, but rather receive `undefined` as the result if it
     * does not exist, set the second parameter to `false`.

     * will not display any meaningful feedback icon.  To clear all validation
     * feedback, omit both arguments, or call `setValidationResult(null)`.  The
     * meanings of these indicators are as follows.
     * 
     *  * `"valid"`: the atom represents correct mathematical work
     *  * `"invalid"`: the atom represents incorrect mathematical work
     *  * `"indeterminate"`: the atom cannot be clearly classified as valid or

     *    settings specify that such things should not be aggressively marked
     *    wrong, but just indeterminate, to request more specificity)
     *  * `"error"`: the software encountered an internal error while attempting
     *    to validate the atom.  (Obviously this is to be avoided!  It is
     *    available to use if an internal error occurs, so that the user gets
     *    truthful feedback in such a case, and can report the bug so that we
     *    can set about trying to fix it.  But of course we strive to write
     *    software does not encounter errors, and thus in which this type of
     *    feedback is never actually seen by a user.)
     * 
     * The second argument should be the text to be shown when the user hovers
     * their mouse over the atom.  You can omit this if you do not want any
     * such text, but it is recommended to always have such text, for the user's
     * benefit.  Note that browsers do not support HTML tags in such hover text
     * panels, but they do support newline characters (`"\n"`).

 * This function should be called in the editor's setup routine.  It installs a
 * single mouse event handler into the editor that can watch for click events to
 * any atom, and route control flow to the event handler for that atom's type.
 * It also installs a keydown event handler that watches for the Enter key
 * being pressed on an atom, and routes control flow to the event handler for
 * that atom's type.
 * 
 * Second, it installs an event handler that calls every atom's update handler
 * whenever the editor's content changes.  This could be slow if there are many
 * atoms in the document, and therefore we use the
 * {@link module:Utilities.forEachWithTimeout forEachWithTimeout()} function to
 * let these handlers run only when the UI is idle.  We have found this to be
 * necessary, because some atoms (especially those whose representation is
 * generated from MathLive) are not always typeset correctly the first time that
 * their HTML is placed into the atom.  For some reason, the stylesheet does not
 * seem to apply correctly until the *second* insertion of the typeset HTML.
 * 
 * Finally, it installs a context menu function that may create a custom context
 * menu if the user right-clicks on an atom in the document.
 * 
 * @param {tinymce.Editor} editor - the editor in which to install the event
