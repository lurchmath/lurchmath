/**
 * A FileSystem is a place where files can be saved and/or loaded.  This is
 * intentionally vague, so that many different types of sources or destinations
 * can be treated as filesystems, each with different features.  Examples
 * include each of the following, which will be implemented as subclasses:
 * 
 *  - A cloud storage platform such as Dropbox, which has a wide variety of
 *    features for listing, loading, saving, deleting, and renaming files.
 *  - The browser's `localStorage` object, which can store arbitrary key-value
 *    pairs, and can thus be used as a simple file system with all the same
 *    features as a cloud storage platform, but very limited space and no
 *    transferability between browsers or computers.
 *  - The user's hard drive, which can load and save files only with manual user
 *    intervention, and which does not let a web application list folder
 *    contents, delete files, or rename files.
 *  - A web repository of files, such as a GitHub repository or simply a folder
 *    on a public server, which can list files and load them, but will not let
 *    this web application save, delete, or rename files in that web repository.
 * 
 * This class therefore provides many abstract methods for the various actions
 * described above (loading, saving, etc.) and is intended to be subclassed to
 * implement specific file systems.
 * 
 * We formalize here tne definition of one central concept, a "file object."  It
 * will be a JavaScript object with some subset of the following fields.
 * 
 *  - `fileSystemName` - the name of the file system from which the file
 *    originated or was last saved.  If this field is absent, then the file was
 *    created in the application and has not yet been saved anywhere.
 *  - `filename` - the name of the file in the file system, written in a way
 *    that is sensible for a human user to read.  For example, some cloud
 *    storage systems might have unique IDs for files that are not
 *    human-readable, but by contrast this field should be the name the user
 *    gave the file.  This field should be set when a file is read from a file
 *    system, and will be absent if and only if one of the following is true:
 *     - the user created the file in the application and has not yet saved it
 *     - the user saved the file to a file system that does not tell the
 *       application the name that the user chose, such as the user's hard drive
 *       through a download operation
 *     - the file object represents a folder, as documented below
 *  - `UID` - a unique identifier for the file in the file system.  This is not
 *    necessarily a globally unique ID, but is unique within the file system
 *    named in the first attribute, above.  This field should not be present if
 *    the `fileSystemName` field is absent, because a file system gives the file
 *    its ID, so we cannot have this field without the other first.  Some
 *    file systems may be sufficiently simple that they operate using only the
 *    human-readable filename in the `filename` field, in which case this field
 *    can be omitted.
 *  - `path` - a string representing the path in which the file is stored.  If
 *    the file system does not use paths, then this may be absent.  But a file
 *    object can represent a folder by setting this field to a path but omitting
 *    the filename and UID.  Such a file object can be passed as the parameter
 *    to the file listing function to list the contents of a folder, or the file
 *    open function, to specify which folder's files the user should be choosing
 *    from by default.
 *  - `contents` - the contents of the file, as a string.  This field will be
 *    present if the file object is one that the application wants to save, by
 *    passing to a saving function, because obviously the file cannot be saved
 *    without its content.  Similarly, the field will be present if this file
 *    object is being returned from a file loading operation, since that was the
 *    purpose of the operation.  But this field may be absent if the file object
 *    is part of a directory listing, or is a parameter being passed to a file
 *    loading function, since the contents are either unnecessary or impossible
 *    in such situations.

     * Anyone reimplementing this function must ensure that, whenever the user
     * interacts with the dialog items to choose a save destination, the event
     * handlers in one or more of the items returned by this function must
     * notify the dialog of what has changed by calling
     * `dialog.setLocation(fileObject)`.  The parameter should either be a file
     * object as documented at the top of {@link FileSystem this class}, or it
     * should be omitted to indicate that no (valid) destination is currently
     * specified.  This same function should be called during one of the items'
     * `onShow()` handlers as well, to initialize which destination is specified
     * when the tab containing these dialog items first appears.  (In many
     * cases, no file will be chosen initially, and you can call
     * `dialog.setLocation()` with no argument.)  Failure to follow this
     * convention will result in undefined behavior.
     * 
     * Calls to `dialog.setLocation()` never need to pass a file object with a
     * `contents` field, since the contents can be filled in afterwards by the
     * caller, and before a call to {@link FileSystem#write write()}.
     * 
     * If the client wants the UI to start out referring to a specific location
     * in the file system, such as the last folder or file where the user saved
     * something, it can pass a file object with the `filename` and/or `path`
     * fields set to the file or folder at which browsing should begin.
     * 
     * @returns {Object[]?} a list of dialog items representing this file system

     * successful file save.
     * 
     *  1. Delete the most recent auto-save.  If we did not delete the
     *     auto-saved content, then on the next launch of the application, the
     *     user would be alerted to the fact that unsaved work existed in the
     *     auto-save file and could be recovered for them.  But that would be
     *     false, because of course, they just did save their work.
     *  2. Store the file object representing the file just saved, so that it
     *     can be stored in the {@link LurchDocument} for the editor.  If the
     *     user later invokes a "save" menu item, its event handler can use the
     *     stored file object as the parameter to the {@link FileSystem#write
     *     write()} method.
     * 
     * The file object passed to this function should have enough uniquely
     * identifying information in its `filename`, `UID`, and `path` members to
     * satisfy the requirements of the {@link FileSystem#write write()} method
     * for the same file system subclass.  If its `contents` member has data in
     * it, that data will be ignored, so that it is not unnecessarily copied.
     * No `fileSystemName` needs to be provided; each subclass will use its own.
     * 
     * @param {Object} fileObject - the file object representing the file that
     *   was just saved (and whose format is documented in the {@link
